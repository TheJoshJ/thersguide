# Using MDX Components

MDX allows you to use React components directly in your markdown content. TheRSGuide includes several custom components to enhance your guides and make them more interactive.

## What is MDX?

MDX is markdown with JSX support. It allows you to:
- Write markdown content
- Use React components directly
- Create interactive elements
- Build rich, dynamic documentation

## How to Use MDX Components

### No Imports Needed

All MDX components are automatically available in your files. **No import statements required!** Just use them directly:

```mdx
## My Guide

You need <SkillReq>67 Firemaking</SkillReq> to burn magic logs.
```

### Basic Syntax

MDX components use JSX syntax:

```mdx
<ComponentName prop="value">
  content
</ComponentName>
```

Or for self-closing components:

```mdx
<ComponentName />
```

## Example: Skill and Quest Requirements

TheRSGuide provides components for checking skill levels and quest completion status:

### Skill Requirements

Use `<SkillReq>` to check if a player meets skill level requirements:

```mdx
- <SkillReq>67 Firemaking</SkillReq> for magic logs
- <SkillReq>80 Attack</SkillReq> for high-level combat
- <SkillReq>50 Woodcutting</SkillReq> for cutting logs
```

**How it works:**
- Automatically detects skill level and name from the text
- Shows green border if requirement is met
- Shows red border if requirement is not met
- Integrates with the player's username input

### Quest Requirements

Use `<QuestReq>` to check if a player has completed specific quests:

```mdx
- <QuestReq>Dragon Slayer</QuestReq> for rune platebody
- <QuestReq>Desert Treasure</QuestReq> for Ancient Magicks
```

**How it works:**
- Automatically detects quest names
- Shows green border if quest is completed
- Shows red border if quest is not completed

## Live Examples

Here are the components in action:

#### Skill Requirements
- **Firemaking**: You need <SkillReq>67 Firemaking</SkillReq> for magic logs
- **Combat**: Aim for <SkillReq>80 Attack</SkillReq> for high-level slayer

#### Quest Requirements  
- **Dragon Slayer**: Complete <QuestReq>Dragon Slayer</QuestReq> first
- **Desert Treasure**: You'll need <QuestReq>Desert Treasure</QuestReq> for Ancient Magicks

## Component API Reference

For detailed information about all available components, see the [Component API Reference](./mdx-components-api/) directory:

- [SkillReq & QuestReq](./mdx-components-api/skill-quest-requirements)
- [RequirementsChecker](./mdx-components-api/requirements-checker)
- [UserInput](./mdx-components-api/user-input)

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep It Simple
- Use components to enhance content, not replace it
- Don't overuse interactive elements
- Focus on improving user experience

### 2. Test Your Components
- Verify components render correctly
- Check that requirement checking works
- Ensure accessibility is maintained

### 3. Consistent Usage
- Use the same component patterns throughout guides
- Follow established naming conventions
- Maintain consistent styling
